		<p>I am Assistant Professor of <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/cs/">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/">University of Memphis</a>.</p>
		<p>I was <a href="https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/ses-funding/hammer-fellows/">Michael Hammer Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a> and I received my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.unc.edu/">UNC Chapel Hill</a>, working with <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~lin/">Ming C. Lin</a>. I have also spent time at Disney Research, Lenovo Research, National University of Singapore, and George Mason University.</p>
		<p>I am passionate about using simulation and machine learning (especially reinforcement learning) to design and develop next-gen cyber-physical infrastructure for urban environments. The main themes of my current research are transportation autonomy and urban mobility.
