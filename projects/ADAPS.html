	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	Autonomous driving has gained significant advancements
	in recent years. However, obtaining a robust control
	policy for driving remains challenging as it requires training
	data from a variety of scenarios, including rare situations (e.g.,
	accidents), an effective policy architecture, and an efficient
	learning mechanism. We propose ADAPS for producing robust
	control policies for autonomous vehicles. ADAPS consists of two
	simulation platforms in generating and analyzing accidents to
	automatically produce labeled training data, and a memoryenabled
	hierarchical control policy. Additionally, ADAPS offers
	a more efficient online learning mechanism that reduces the
	number of iterations required in learning compared to existing
	methods such as DAGGER. We present both theoretical
	and experimental results. The latter are produced in simulated
	environments, where qualitative and quantitative results are
	generated to demonstrate the benefits of ADAPS.
